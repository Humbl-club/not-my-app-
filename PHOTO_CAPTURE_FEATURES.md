### Analysis Criteria

The system performs comprehensive analysis checking:

#### **Photo Quality (Technical)**
- ✅ Resolution (minimum 600x600px)
- ✅ File size (50KB - 5MB)
- ✅ Aspect ratio (square format preferred)
- ✅ Image sharpness (Laplacian edge detection)

- ✅ Format validation (JPEG/PNG only)

#### **Content Validation (Government Requirements)**
- ✅ Face detection (single person only)
- ✅ Face positioning (centered, proper size)
- ✅ Background uniformity (plain, light-colored)
- ✅ No multiple faces
- ✅ Face size ratio (50-70% of frame)
- ✅ Expression detection (neutral preferred)

#### **Security Checks**
- ✅ EXIF metadata stripping (privacy)
- ✅ Magic byte validation (file authenticity)
- ✅ XSS prevention (sanitized inputs)
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 uploads per minute)
- ✅ File type verification (MIME + extension)

## 💻 Implementation Example

```typescript
import { EnhancedPhotoCapture } from '@/components/EnhancedPhotoCapture';

// Usage in component
<EnhancedPhotoCapture
  onPhotoCapture={(photoData, score, metadata) => {
    // photoData: base64 image string
    // score: 0-100 quality score
    // metadata: detailed analysis results
    console.log(`Photo quality: ${score}%`);
    
    if (score >= 75) {
      // Photo meets requirements
      savePhoto(photoData);
    } else {
      // Suggest retake
      showWarning('Photo quality issues detected');
    }
  }}
  fieldName="passportPhoto"
  title="Upload Passport Photo"
  documentType="passport"
/>
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Face detection models loaded on demand
   - Compression worker initialized when needed
   - Component code-splitting

2. **Image Processing**
   - Canvas-based operations
   - Web Worker compression
   - Efficient memory management
   - Automatic cleanup

3. **Caching**
   - Model caching for face detection
   - Result memoization
   - Browser cache utilization

## ✅ Government Compliance

The system meets requirements for:
- UK Government Digital Service standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
- GDPR privacy regulations
- International passport photo standards
- Biometric data handling guidelines

## 🔄 Fallback Mechanisms

If advanced features fail:
1. Face detection → Basic quality checks
2. Compression → Original file upload
3. Camera access → File upload
4. Analysis → Manual review flag

## 📈 Success Metrics
