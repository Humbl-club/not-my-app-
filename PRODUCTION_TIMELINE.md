## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### **High-Risk Days & Contingencies**

#### **Day 2 - Supabase Setup**
**Risk:** Migration failures or data corruption  
**Mitigation:** 
- Complete database backup before migration
- Test migrations on staging first
- Have rollback scripts ready
- Allocated extra buffer time

#### **Day 3 - Payment Integration**
**Risk:** Stripe webhook configuration issues  
**Mitigation:**
- Test webhooks thoroughly in sandbox
- Have Stripe support contact ready
- Fallback to manual payment processing
- Monitor Stripe dashboard closely

#### **Day 8-9 - Performance Testing**
**Risk:** Performance issues discovered late  
**Mitigation:**
- Start performance monitoring early
- Have optimization strategies ready
- Consider infrastructure scaling
- Buffer time for optimization

### **Contingency Plans**

#### **Critical Issue Discovery**
- **Days 1-5:** Extend Phase 1 by 1-2 days, compress Phase 2
- **Days 6-10:** Focus on critical path, defer nice-to-have features
- **Days 11-15:** Implement minimum viable launch, improve post-launch

#### **Third-Party Service Issues**
- **Supabase:** Fallback to self-hosted PostgreSQL
- **Stripe:** Implement offline payment collection
- **CDN:** Use multiple CDN providers
- **Monitoring:** Use free alternatives initially
